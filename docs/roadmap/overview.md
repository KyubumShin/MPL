# MPL Roadmap: v1.0→v5.0 Evolution and Remaining Plans

## Vision: "Phase 0 Enhanced + Phase 5 Minimized"

MPL's core philosophy is **strengthening pre-specification (Phase 0) to make post-correction (Phase 5) unnecessary**. Through 7 experiments (Exp 1~8, excluding Exp 2), it was empirically verified that tokens invested in Phase 0 can completely eliminate the debugging/correction cost of Phase 5.

In v3.0, this vision has been **fully implemented**, and additionally, features not in the roadmap (Pre-Execution Analysis, 5-Gate quality, Convergence Detection, etc.) were also introduced.

---

## Experiment Achievement Matrix

All 7 experiments achieved 77/77 = 100% (based on final test suite). These experiment results became the basis for the Phase 0 Enhanced design in v3.0.

| Experiment | Phase 0 technique | Cumulative score progress | v3.0 reflection |
|------------|------------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| Exp 1 | API contract extraction | 34/89 (38%) → 77/77 (100%) | Step 1: API Contract Extraction |
| Exp 3 | Example pattern analysis | 52/89 (58%) → 77/77 (100%) | Step 2: Example Pattern Analysis |
| Exp 4 | Type policy definition | 58/89 (65%) → 77/77 (100%) | Step 3: Type Policy Definition |
| Exp 5 | Test stub generation | 69/89 (77%) → 77/77 (100%) | Build-Test-Fix micro cycle |
| Exp 6 | Incremental testing | 74/89 (83%) → 77/77 (100%) | Incremental Verification |
| Exp 7 | Error specification | 77/77 (100%) | Step 4: Error Specification |
| Exp 8 | Hybrid verification | 77/77 (100%) | 5-Gate quality system |

> **Key finding**: The cumulative score progression (38% → 58% → 65% → 77% → 83% → 100%) shows that scores monotonically increase as Phase 0 techniques are added. This finding became the basis for the complexity-adaptive Phase 0 design.

## Phase 0 Enhanced: 4-Step Process

Synthesizing experiment results, a complete Phase 0 consists of 4 steps. **Fully implemented** in v3.0:

```
Step 1: API Contract Extraction (Exp 1) ─── function signatures, parameter order
Step 2: Example Pattern Analysis (Exp 3) ── usage patterns, defaults, edge cases
Step 3: Type Policy Definition (Exp 4) ──── type hints, collection type rules
Step 4: Error Specification (Exp 7) ──────── standard exceptions, message patterns
```

Each step improves scores independently, but synergy is maximized when combined. Applied steps are automatically selected based on complexity.

## Token Budget Reallocation

Token budget changes from v1.0 to v3.0. v3.0 changed structure by replacing Phase 5 with Fix Loop + 5-Gate:

```
v1.0 (original)                     v3.0 (achieved)
┌──────────────────────────┐        ┌──────────────────────────┐
│ Phase 0:  ~5K  ( 6%)     │        │ Phase 0: 8~25K (adaptive) │
│ Phase 1: ~15K (19%)      │        │ Phase execution: adaptive  │
│ Phase 2: ~15K (19%)      │        │ 5-Gate: ~2K              │
│ Phase 3: ~15K (19%)      │        │ Fix Loop: 0~10K (conditional) │
│ Phase 4: ~15K (19%)      │        │ Finalize: ~2K            │
│ Phase 5: ~16K (20%)      │        │                          │
│ ─────────────────────    │        │ Phase 0 cache hit: ~0K   │
│ Total:   ~81K            │        │ Total: variable by complexity │
└──────────────────────────┘        └──────────────────────────┘
```

## v0.6.0 — 2-Pass Decomposition + Phase Seed + 2-Level Parallelism (2026-03-22)

### Summary

v0.6.0 introduces Phase Seeds — per-phase immutable specifications generated just-in-time. This is the largest structural change since v3.0, replacing ad-hoc mini-plan generation with deterministic, auditable execution specifications.

### Changes

| ID | Feature | Type | Description |
|----|---------|------|-------------|
| D-01a | **2-Pass Decomposition** | Structural | Decomposer Pass 1 produces skeleton (order + deps + scope). New `mpl-phase-seed-generator` (sonnet) produces per-phase Seeds just-in-time with concrete TODO structure, acceptance mapping, embedded Phase 0 context, and formal exit conditions. |
| D-01b | **TODO Parallel Graph** | Enhancement | Seed's `depends_on` + `files_to_modify` enable pre-planned Worker parallelism. F-13 runtime detection → Seed-based pre-planning. |
| D-01c | **Phase Parallel Execution** | Structural | CORE phases: always sequential. EXTENSION/SUPPORT phases: parallel in worktree isolation when no file overlap. Decomposer outputs `execution_tiers` with parallel flags. |

### New Agent

| Agent | Role | Model |
|-------|------|-------|
| `mpl-phase-seed-generator` | Generate immutable Phase Seed per phase with TODO structure + acceptance mapping | sonnet |

### New Steps

| Step | Name | When |
|------|------|------|
| 4.0 | Execution Tier Dispatch | Before phase loop — routes to parallel or sequential |
| 4.0.5 | JIT Phase Seed Generation | Before each Phase Runner — generates Seed |

### Affected Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `agents/mpl-phase-seed-generator.md` | NEW — Phase Seed generation agent |
| `agents/mpl-decomposer.md` | execution_tiers + Step 11 + failure mode |
| `agents/mpl-phase-runner.md` | Layer 3.5 + Step 2 dual mode + exit condition evaluation |
| `commands/mpl-run-execute.md` | Step 4.0 tier dispatch + Step 4.0.5 JIT seed + context + prompt |

### Migration (0.5.1 → 0.6.0)

Breaking changes: NONE. Phase Runner has Legacy fallback when Seed absent. Rollback: `phase_seed: { enabled: false }` in config.json.

## v4.1 — MCP Server Tier 1: Deterministic Scoring + Active State (2026-03-22)

### Summary

v4.1 introduces the MPL MCP Server, eliminating LLM scoring variance and enabling agents to actively query pipeline state.

### Changes

| ID | Feature | Type | Description |
|----|---------|------|-------------|
| M-01 | **MCP Server Tier 1** | New server | 3 MCP tools: `mpl_score_ambiguity` (5D scoring via haiku API temp 0.1 + code computation), `mpl_state_read` (active state query for agents), `mpl_state_write` (atomic state update). TypeScript + @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, stdio transport. All tools have graceful fallback when server unavailable. |

### Architecture

```
MPL/mcp-server/
├── src/index.ts              # Server entry + tool registration
├── src/tools/scoring.ts      # mpl_score_ambiguity
├── src/tools/state.ts        # mpl_state_read + mpl_state_write
├── src/lib/state-manager.ts  # Ported from hooks/lib/mpl-state.mjs
└── src/lib/llm-scorer.ts     # Anthropic API scoring (haiku, temp 0.1)
```

### New Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `mcp-server/` | Complete MCP server (TypeScript, compiled to dist/) |
| `.mcp.json` | MCP server registration for Claude Code |

### Key Design Decisions

- **haiku for scoring**: ~$0.001/call, sufficient accuracy at temp 0.1, 10x cheaper than sonnet
- **Code-computed weighted sum**: LLM scores dimensions, but weighted average is deterministic code
- **Graceful fallback**: All tools degrade to existing behavior when MCP unavailable
- **State port**: `state-manager.ts` is a TypeScript port of `hooks/lib/mpl-state.mjs` with identical schema

## v4.0 — Feasibility Defense, Browser QA, PR Creation (2026-03-22)

### Summary

v4.0 adds verification depth: catching infeasible specs earlier, validating UI in real browsers, and automating PR creation.

### Changes

| ID | Feature | Type | Description |
|----|---------|------|-------------|
| T-11 | **Feasibility 2-Layer Defense** | Agent extension | **Layer 1**: Stage 2 PP Conformance Check extended with `INFEASIBLE` classification. Checks API availability, constraint compatibility, tech viability, scope via Grep/Glob on codebase — catches ~80% of feasibility issues during interview at zero additional cost. **Layer 2**: Decomposer `go_no_go` extended with `RE_INTERVIEW` signal + `re_interview_questions` field. Safety net for Phase 0-dependent issues. |
| T-03 | **Browser QA (Gate 1.7)** | New agent + Gate | New `mpl-qa-agent` validates UI via Claude in Chrome MCP tools (tabs, read_page, find, console, screenshot). Gate 1.7 inserted between Gate 1.5 and Gate 2. **Non-blocking** — issues defer to Step 5.5. Graceful skip when Chrome MCP unavailable. |
| T-04 | **PR Creation (Step 5.4b)** | Agent extension + Step | `mpl-git-master` extended with PR creation mode (`pr_creation: true`). Creates feature branch, pushes, opens PR via `gh pr create` with Gate evidence + deferred items in body. Optional, activated by config or prompt keywords. |

### New Agent

| Agent | Role | Model |
|-------|------|-------|
| `mpl-qa-agent` | Browser QA — validates UI via Chrome MCP, reports console errors, accessibility, element presence | sonnet |

### Affected Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `agents/mpl-ambiguity-resolver.md` | INFEASIBLE classification + feasibility scan + question template |
| `agents/mpl-decomposer.md` | RE_INTERVIEW go_no_go + re_interview_questions + Step 10.5 |
| `commands/mpl-run-decompose.md` | RE_INTERVIEW handling |
| `agents/mpl-qa-agent.md` | NEW — Browser QA agent |
| `commands/mpl-run-execute.md` | Gate 1.7 Browser QA |
| `agents/mpl-git-master.md` | PR creation mode |
| `commands/mpl-run-finalize.md` | Step 5.4b PR Creation |

## v3.9 — Autonomous Execution, Phase Lock, Budget Pause (2026-03-22)

### Summary

v3.9 focuses on autonomous execution — reducing mid-pipeline human interruptions and improving session resilience.

### Changes

| ID | Feature | Type | Description |
|----|---------|------|-------------|
| T-10 | **Post-Execution Review (Step 5.5)** | Protocol extension | H-items now have severity (HIGH/MED/LOW). Gate 3 only blocks on HIGH H-items; MED/LOW are deferred to Step 5.5 post-execution review report. Step 5.0 Final Side Interview removed (absorbed into 5.5). Users review deferred items once at the end, not mid-pipeline. |
| T-01 P2 | **Phase-Scoped File Lock** | Hook + new parser | New `mpl-decomposition-parser.mjs` extracts per-phase file scopes from decomposition.yaml. `mpl-write-guard` checks if Edit/Write targets are within the current phase's declared scope. Soft warning (non-blocking) on out-of-scope writes. |
| F-33 | **Session Budget Prediction** | Predictor + protocol | `writeSessionHandoff()` added to budget predictor. Step 4.8 Graceful Pause Protocol: calls predictBudget() after each phase, writes handoff signal on "pause_now". Watcher docs added. Completes the predict→pause→signal→resume loop. |

### Affected Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `agents/mpl-verification-planner.md` | H-item severity field (HIGH/MED/LOW) + criteria table |
| `commands/mpl-run-execute.md` | Gate 3 severity filter + Step 4.8 Graceful Pause |
| `commands/mpl-run-finalize.md` | Step 5.5 Post-Execution Review + watcher docs |
| `hooks/lib/mpl-decomposition-parser.mjs` | NEW — YAML parser for phase scope extraction |
| `hooks/mpl-write-guard.mjs` | Phase-scoped file lock check |
| `hooks/lib/mpl-budget-predictor.mjs` | writeSessionHandoff() function |

---

## v3.8 — Safety, Core-First Ordering, Compaction Recovery (2026-03-22)

### Summary

v3.8 adds three low-risk, high-value improvements focused on safety, decomposition quality, and session resilience.

### Changes

| ID | Feature | Type | Description |
|----|---------|------|-------------|
| T-01 | **Dangerous Command Detection** | Hook extension | `mpl-write-guard` now intercepts Bash tool calls containing dangerous patterns (rm -rf, git push --force, DROP TABLE, kubectl delete, etc.). Safe cleanup patterns (rm -rf node_modules) are allowlisted. Soft warning (same as Edit/Write guard). |
| T-12 | **Core-First Phase Ordering** | Decomposer prompt | New Step 4.5 in decomposer: classify phases as CORE/EXTENSION/SUPPORT based on PP connection. Within dependency-equivalent tiers, sort CORE → EXTENSION → SUPPORT. Ensures core functionality is verified first; sub-feature failures don't affect core. |
| F-31 | **Compaction Recovery Read-Side** | Protocol extension | Compaction checkpoints (created by PreCompact hook since v3.2) are now loaded during context assembly (Case 2: after compaction) and injected into Phase Runner context. Resume protocol also checks for checkpoints. Completes the write→read loop. |

### Stage 2 Redesign (PP-Aligned Spec Resolution)

Also included in this release: Stage 2 (Ambiguity Resolver) redesigned to treat PPs as immutable inputs.

| Change | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| PP mutability | Stage 2 could update PP.judgment_criteria | **PPs are never modified by Stage 2** |
| Pre-resolution | Jump straight to Socratic questions | **PP Conformance Check**: auto-resolve items derivable from PP + context |
| Scoring dimensions | 4D (Spec/Edge/Tech/Testability) | **5D** (+PP Conformance: detects choices conflicting with PPs) |
| PP conflicts | Not tracked | **PP_CONFLICT** items raise ambiguity score; user chooses PP-first or exception |
| Output | Updated PPs + requirements | **PP-aligned spec** (PPs unchanged) + requirements |

### Affected Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `hooks/mpl-write-guard.mjs` | Added Bash dangerous command detection (9 patterns + 8 safe allowlist) |
| `hooks/hooks.json` | PreToolUse matcher: `Edit\|Write` → `Edit\|Write\|Bash` |
| `agents/mpl-decomposer.md` | Step 4.5 (feature priority), `feature_priority` output field, failure mode |
| `agents/mpl-ambiguity-resolver.md` | Full rewrite: PP immutability, PP Conformance Check, 5D scoring |
| `commands/mpl-run-execute.md` | Checkpoint loading in Case 2 + Phase Runner recovery context section |
| `commands/mpl-run-finalize.md` | Checkpoint-aware resume in Step 6 |
| `docs/design.md` | Version bump, Stage 2 description + agent catalog updated |

---

## v3.7 — 2-Stage Interview Redesign (2026-03-15)

### Design Direction

v3.7 fundamentally redesigns the interview pipeline. It transitions from the existing "4 rounds for PP confirmation → PP dimension re-measurement" structure to "value-centered PP discovery → metrics-based ambiguity resolution loop".

> Inspired by Ouroboros's AmbiguityScorer: metrics, not structure (rounds), determine questions.
> Ambiguity is re-measured after each response, and the weakest dimension is automatically targeted.

### Key Changes

| Change | Before (v3.6) | After (v3.7) |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Stage 1 question framing** | Technical category classification ("What is the core identity?") | User value/scenario centered ("What can the user do?") |
| **Stage 2 agent** | `mpl-weak-interviewer` (PP 5-dimension re-measurement) | `mpl-ambiguity-resolver` (PP orthogonal 4-dimension metrics loop) |
| **Stage 2 dimensions** | Goal/Boundary/Priority/Criteria/Context (PP redundant) | Spec Completeness/Edge Case/Technical Decision/Acceptance Testability (PP orthogonal) |
| **Termination condition** | Question count soft limit | `ambiguity <= 0.2` (80% clarity) quantitative threshold |
| **AskUserQuestion options** | Word/short description | Contrast-Based: gain/sacrifice + concrete scenario examples |
| **Technical choice questions** | Present options immediately | Pre-Research Protocol: present comparison table first, then ask |

### New Protocols

- **Pre-Research Protocol**: Before questions with technology selection trade-offs, collect comparison materials via WebFetch/Read → present comparison table → ask. Applied in both Stage 1 and Stage 2.
- **Contrast-Based Options**: All AskUserQuestion options must include "what do you gain and what do you sacrifice" + concrete examples.
- **Spec Reading Step**: At start of Stage 2, compare provided spec/documents with PP to identify gap/conflict/hidden constraints.

### Affected Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `agents/mpl-interviewer.md` | Rewrite 4 rounds as value-centered + Pre-Research Protocol |
| `agents/mpl-ambiguity-resolver.md` | New (replaces mpl-weak-interviewer) |
| `agents/mpl-weak-interviewer.md` | Deleted |
| `commands/mpl-run-phase0.md` | Update Stage 2 reference |
| `docs/design.md` | Update agent catalog |
| `hooks/mpl-validate-output.mjs` | Update agent name + verification keywords |

## v3.2 Roadmap — "Documents as Memory + Adaptive Routing" (2026-03-07)

### Design Direction

v3.2 evolves along two axes:

**Axis 1: Documents as Memory** — Continuity between sessions and executions

> The success of long-running agents comes not from model intelligence but from **operational structure**.
> — [Run long-horizon tasks with Codex](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gb-jeong_run-long-horizon-tasks-with-codex-activity-7435825294554484736-hBEX)

**Axis 2: Adaptive Pipeline Routing** — Users don't judge complexity

> Resolves the paradox where lightweight task entry barriers increase as MPL grows more complex.
> Inspired by Ouroboros's PAL Router (Progressive Adaptive LLM Router),
> integrates 3 skills (mpl/mpl-small/mpl-bugfix) into **single entry point + automatic tier classification + dynamic escalation**.
> — [Ouroboros](https://github.com/Q00/ouroboros) analysis (2026-03-07)

#### 4-Document Mapping (Axis 1)

| Reference document | Role | MPL equivalent | Status |
|-------------------|------|---------------|--------|
| `docs/prompt.md` | Goal/non-goal, freeze completion criteria | `pivot-points.md` | ✅ Present |
| `docs/plans.md` | Acceptance criteria + verification commands per milestone | `decomposition.yaml` | ✅ Present |
| `docs/implement.md` | plans as SSOT, scope expansion prohibited | `mpl-run.md` (orchestrator protocol) | ✅ Present |
| `docs/documentation.md` | Audit log, continuity between sessions | **Missing** → newly created as `RUNBOOK.md` | ❌ Not implemented |

MPL already has strong documents 1~3, but is lacking 4 — "audit log combined with shared memory". Current State Summary is fragmented per phase, and there is no integrated document for humans or next-session agents to grasp at a glance "how far we've come and why these decisions were made".

#### Adaptive Pipeline Router (Axis 2) — Problem and Solution

**Current problem**: 3 skill branches depend on user keywords.

```
"mpl bugfix" → mpl-bugfix (minimal pipeline)
"mpl small"  → mpl-small  (3-Phase lightweight)
"mpl"        → mpl full   (9+ step full)
```

| Problem | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| User judgment dependency | Must decide in advance "is this small or full?" |
| Duplication with Triage | full's Triage (Step 0) already analyzes information density, but small bypasses it |
| No escalation | Start small → complex → circuit break → user must re-run full |
| No downgrade | Start full → actually simple → full 9+ step overhead |
| Token gap | No optimal path between bugfix (~5-10K) ↔ small (~15-25K) ↔ full (~50-100K+) |

**Solution**: Adapt Ouroboros PAL Router approach to MPL.

```
Before: User selects from 3
  "mpl bugfix: fix login error"         → mpl-bugfix
  "mpl small: add validation"           → mpl-small
  "mpl: refactor auth system"           → mpl full

After: System auto-determines + dynamic switching
  "mpl fix login error"                 → Triage → Frugal (≈bugfix)
  "mpl add validation"                  → Triage → Standard (≈small extended)
  "mpl refactor auth system"            → Triage → Frontier (≈full)
  (automatic escalation on circuit break during execution)
```

### All Items

#### HIGH — Core Architecture

| ID | Item | Status | Description |
|----|------|--------|-------------|
| F-20 | **Adaptive Pipeline Router — Single Entry Point** | ✅ **S1 complete** | Extend Triage (Step 0) to auto-calculate `pipeline_tier` (frugal/standard/frontier). Measure affected file count, test presence, import depth via Quick Scope Scan (Glob/Grep, ~1-2K tokens). Determine tier via `pipeline_score` formula. Integrate keyword-detector as single entry point (remove separate mpl-bugfix/mpl-small branches). User hints (bugfix/small) function only as tier overrides. **Ouroboros PAL Router reference** |
| F-21 | **Dynamic Escalation/Downgrade** | ✅ **S1 complete** | Automatic tier switching during execution. Frugal circuit break → escalate to Standard → still failing → escalate to Frontier. On escalation, preserve completed work, re-run only failed phase with expanded pipeline. Downgrade implemented via previous routing pattern reference in Phase 0 (F-22 linkage) |
| F-10 | **RUNBOOK.md — Integrated Execution Log** | ✅ **S1 complete** | Introduce `docs/documentation.md` concept to MPL. Auto-update Current Status, Milestone Progress, Key Decisions, Known Issues, How to Resume sections in `.mpl/mpl/RUNBOOK.md` during pipeline execution. Anyone — human or agent — can grasp current status and resume immediately from this single file |
| F-11 | **Run-to-Run Learning Accumulation** | ✅ **S2 complete** | RUNBOOK decisions/issues distilled via `mpl-compound` to `.mpl/memory/learnings.md` on execution completion. Auto-loaded in next execution Phase 0. Accumulates failure patterns (type confusion, error mismatch), success patterns, project conventions (discovered). **Flow**: Record in RUNBOOK during execution → compound distillation → next Phase 0 reference |
| F-12 | **In-session Context Persistence** | ✅ **S2 complete** | Orchestrator marks key state (current phase, PP summary, last failure cause) with `<remember priority>` tags at each phase transition. Dual safety net of RUNBOOK.md (file-based) and `<remember>` (tag-based) to handle context compression during long executions |
| F-04 | Standalone independent operation | ✅ **S4 complete** | (existing) OMC dependency removed. Grep/Glob fallback |

#### MEDIUM — Execution Efficiency and UX

| ID | Item | Status | Description |
|----|------|--------|-------------|
| F-22 | **Routing Pattern Learning** | ✅ **S2 complete** | Append execution results (task description, tier, success, token usage) to `.mpl/memory/routing-patterns.jsonl`. Recommend initial tier in next execution Triage by comparing against previous patterns via Jaccard similarity (≥0.8). Separate file from F-11 learnings.md — learnings is technical lessons, routing-patterns is cost optimization data. **Ouroboros DowngradeManager reference** |
| F-13 | **Background Execution** | ✅ **S3 complete** | Parallel execution of workers for independent TODOs without file conflicts using `run_in_background: true` within Phase Runner. Combined with v3.1 file conflict detection to auto-enforce sequential execution on conflicts |
| F-14 | **AskUserQuestion HITL** | ✅ **existing implementation** | `AskUserQuestion` tool used in `mpl-interviewer` PP interview + Side Interview. Clickable options improve HITL response speed |
| F-15 | **Worktree Isolated Execution** | ✅ **S5 complete** | Execute phases with risk=HIGH in Pre-Execution Analysis with `isolation: "worktree"`. Merge on success, auto-cleanup on failure. Partial rollback not needed on circuit break. Activated only in Frontier tier |
| F-16 | **mpl-scout agent** | ✅ **S4 complete** | Haiku-based lightweight codebase exploration agent. Used for Phase 0 structure analysis, Fix Loop root cause exploration, Phase Runner context assistance. Only Read/Glob/Grep/LSP allowed. Saves sonnet/opus tokens. Claude Code's Guide subagent pattern — extend functionality without adding tools. **"Seeing like an Agent" Progressive Disclosure reference** |
| F-17 | **lsp_diagnostics_directory integration** | ✅ **S4 complete** | Project-wide type check before Gate 1 auto tests. Active when tool_mode=full, fallback to `tsc --noEmit` / `python -m py_compile` in standalone |
| F-23 | **Phase Runner Task-based TODO management** | ✅ **S3 complete** | Phase Runner manages TODOs via Task tool instead of mini-plan.md checkboxes. Cross-worker dependency tracking, automatic parallel execution state sync. Current mini-plan.md pattern has same limitation as Claude Code's early TodoWrite — model gets trapped in list and inter-agent communication is impossible. Synergy with F-13 (Background Execution): dispatch independent TODOs as parallel Tasks. **"Seeing like an Agent" TodoWrite→Task lesson reference** |
| F-24 | **Phase Runner Self-Directed Context** | ✅ **S3 complete** | Allow Phase Runner scope-bounded search to directly explore needed context. Current: orchestrator assembles context then injects ("given context"). Improvement: provide only impact files list, Phase Runner directly Read/Grep actual content. Scope-bounded search within that phase's impact range to maintain isolation principle. **"Seeing like an Agent" RAG→self-directed search lesson reference** |
| F-25 | **4-Tier Adaptive Memory** | ✅ **S5 complete** | Synthesis of RUC DeepAgent Memory Folding + Letta (MemGPT) OS paradigm + latest memory research ("Memory in the Age of AI Agents", 2025.12). Expand State Summary to 4-tier memory: `.mpl/memory/episodic.md` (completed Phase summary, time-based compression — recent 2 phases detailed, earlier in 1-2 lines), `semantic.md` (project knowledge generalizing 3+ repeated patterns), `procedural.jsonl` (tool usage patterns, with classification tags), `working.md` (current Phase TODOs). Auto-integration episodic→semantic: on repeated pattern detection, abbreviate in episodic + save generalization in semantic. Selective Phase 0 loading: similarity-based filtering of relevant memory only, not entire files. 70%+ token savings + additional 20-30% Phase 0 time reduction for repeated projects. Synergy with F-11 (learnings.md): auto-distill procedural.jsonl → learnings.md. Complement with F-24 (Self-Directed Context): prioritize effective tools via procedural.jsonl reference. **DeepAgent comparison + Letta + "Memory in the Age of AI Agents" reference** |

#### MEDIUM — Research-Based New (2026-03-13)

| ID | Item | Status | Description |
|----|------|--------|-------------|
| F-26 | **mpl-interviewer v2: Socratic integrated interview** | ✅ **S6 complete** | Extend existing mpl-interviewer to **integrate PP discovery + requirements structuring into a single interview**. Auto-adjust PM role scope by `interview_depth` (skip/light/full). **skip**: direct PP extraction + **Uncertainty Scan** (5-dimension uncertainty check → targeted questions for HIGH items only). **light**: Round 1-2 + lightweight requirements. **full**: Socratic 6 types + solution options 3+ + JUSF. Question limit is **soft limit** — at limit, user chooses continue/stop via **Continue Gate**. On stop, remaining uncertainty tagged as **Deferred Uncertainties** with PP PROVISIONAL + registered for Side Interview for just-in-time resolution during execution. AI_PM Socratic approach adapted. Dual-Layer output (YAML+Markdown). MoSCoW + sequence_score. self-improvement via good/bad examples. **Ouroboros "From Wonder to Ontology" inspiration: uncertainty exists even in detailed documents** — pm-design.md, mpl-interviewer.md reference |
| F-27 | **Reflexion-based Fix Loop learning** | ✅ **S6 complete** | Add structured self-reflection step when entering Fix Loop. Reflexion (NeurIPS 2023) + MAR (Multi-Agent Reflexion) patterns applied. **Reflection Template**: failed TODO → symptom → root cause → first deviation point → correction strategy → learning extraction. Classify reflection results by pattern (type_mismatch, dependency_conflict, test_flake, etc.) and store in procedural.jsonl. Selectively load only relevant patterns in next execution Phase 0 based on task description similarity. Integrate mpl-code-reviewer feedback into reflection on Gate 2 failure (MAR pattern). HumanEval pass@1 +8.1% improvement record (Reflexion). Direct synergy with F-25 (procedural.jsonl). **Reflexion + MAR paper reference** |
| F-28 | **Per-phase dynamic agent routing** | ✅ **S6 complete** | Dynamically adjust worker prompt/model based on Phase characteristics. Currently same mpl-worker assigned to all Phases → auto-select domain-specialized prompts per Phase. TDAG (Task Decomposition and Agent Generation) pattern reference. Example: DB schema Phase → DB-specialized prompt, UI Phase → design-aware prompt, complex algorithm Phase → opus model. Add `phase_domain` tag to Decomposer output → Phase Runner selects matching prompt. **TDAG + Anthropic model routing recommendations reference** |

#### Full Scope Implementation (2026-03-14)

| ID | Item | Status | Description |
|----|------|--------|-------------|
| F-35 | **Full Scope Implementation** | ✅ **complete** | Ensure MPL implements the full scope of a given spec. **4 core changes**: (1) Remove Decomposer's Max Phases hard cap → change to Typical Phases guideline, remove "core function" scoping. (2) Mandatory interview — remove `skip` interview_depth, guarantee minimum `light` (Round 1+2). High-density prompts (density ≥8) also run light + Uncertainty Scan. (3) Side Interview triggered only for CRITICAL + PP conflicts. H-items, AD markers and other non-blocking items logged to `deferred-items.md`. (4) Add insight to Interviewer: interview quality = reduced Side Interview frequency. **Changed files**: `mpl-decomposer.md`, `mpl-run-decompose.md`, `mpl-run-execute.md`, `mpl-run-phase0.md`, `mpl-interviewer.md` |

#### Plan-Phase Compaction Prevention (2026-03-14)

| ID | Item | Status | Description |
|----|------|--------|-------------|
| F-36 | **Plan-Phase Context Offloading** | ✅ **complete** | Prevent compaction in Plan stage (Step 0~3B). **3 changes**: (1) Delegate Step 2 Codebase Analysis to `mpl-codebase-analyzer`(sonnet) subagent (~5-10K savings). (2) Delegate Step 2.5 Phase 0 Enhanced to `mpl-phase0-analyzer`(sonnet) subagent (~8-25K savings). (3) Step 1-E Interview Snapshot — backup key results to `.mpl/mpl/interview-snapshot.md` after interview completion for restoration after compaction. Orchestrator Plan stage tokens: ~29-65K → ~11-16K. **Changed files**: `mpl-run-phase0.md`, new agents `mpl-codebase-analyzer.md`, `mpl-phase0-analyzer.md` |

#### 2-Phase Interview (2026-03-14)

| ID | Item | Status | Description |
|----|------|--------|-------------|
| F-37 | **Clarity Reinforcement (2-Phase Interview)** | ✅ **complete** | Add weak dimension reinforcement (Phase 2) after PP-based interview (Phase 1). Apply OMC Deep Interview's mathematical ambiguity score concept to MPL PP framework. **Core**: 5-Dimension Clarity Scoring (Goal/Boundary/Priority/Criteria/Context, weighted sum) → targeted reinforcement questions for dimensions below 0.6 → PP update. Differentiated Greenfield/Brownfield weights. Infer unrun light rounds from responses. Question limit: 2 for light, 4 for full. **Changed files**: `mpl-interviewer.md`, `mpl-run-phase0.md` |

#### Auto Context Rotation (2026-03-14)

| ID | Item | Status | Description |
|----|------|--------|-------------|
| F-38 | **Auto Context Rotation** | ✅ **complete** | Automatic session rotation when context window is nearly full. Detect compaction event → write handoff signal → send `/clear` via terminal backend (kitty/tmux/osascript) → auto-resume pipeline. Configurable via `mpl-setup`. **Files**: `hooks/lib/rotation-backends.mjs` (terminal backend abstraction), `hooks/lib/mpl-rotator.mjs` (background watcher), `hooks/mpl-session-init.mjs` (SessionStart hook), `hooks/mpl-compaction-tracker.mjs` (modified: write handoff signal), `hooks/hooks.json` (modified: SessionStart registration). **Config**: `.mpl/config.json` → `context_rotation.backend` |

#### Semi-TDAG 4-Layer Template (2026-03-15)

| ID | Item | Status | Description |
|----|------|--------|-------------|
| F-39 | **Semi-TDAG 4-Layer Template Composition** | ✅ **complete** | Extend F-28 domain routing to 4 layers. Decomposer outputs 3 additional optional fields: `phase_subdomain` (tech stack), `phase_task_type` (work type), `phase_lang` (language). Phase Runner combines `domains/` + `subdomains/{domain}/` + `tasks/` + `langs/` 4-Layer prompts and injects into worker context. Total 38 predefined templates: 8 domains + 19 subdomains (react, nextjs, vue, svelte, graphql, websocket, trpc, nosql, orm-prisma, orm-drizzle, langchain, vercel-ai, raw-sdk, optimization, data-structure, docker, cicd, e2e, unit) + 6 task types (greenfield, refactor, migration, bugfix, performance, security) + 5 languages (rust, go, python, typescript, java). Balance stability and flexibility with "dynamic prompt template composition" instead of TDAG pattern's "dynamic agent generation". Each layer is optional — skip that layer if file is missing (F-28 backward compatible). |

#### Compaction Resilience (based on 2026-03-12 experiments)

| ID | Item | Status | Description |
|----|------|--------|-------------|
| F-30 | **Error Context File Preservation** | ✅ **S5 complete** | Preserve full error text in `.mpl/mpl/phases/phase-N/errors/` file on Worker failure. Fix loop converges with accurate error info even after compaction. Phase Runner writes error file, orchestrator receives only the path |
| F-31 | **Compaction-Aware Context Recovery** | Partially implemented | Create `.mpl/mpl/checkpoints/compaction-{N}.md` checkpoint in PreCompact hook. Warn at 3 compaction_count, recommend session reset at 4+. Write-side implementation complete, orchestrator read-side path specification TBD |
| F-32 | **Adaptive Context Loading** | ✅ **S5 complete** | Assess context state at phase transition and 3-way branch load amount: same session (minimal load) / after compaction (selective load+checkpoint) / new session (full load). Compaction detection via `last_phase_compaction_count` field |
| F-33 | **Session Budget Prediction & Auto-Continue** | Partially implemented | Predict remaining Phase budget based on HUD context_window data at Phase completion. Graceful pause when insufficient → create `.mpl/signals/session-handoff.json`. **Implemented**: budget predictor library (`hooks/lib/mpl-budget-predictor.mjs`), HUD bridge (`context-usage.json` recording), orchestrator command (Step 4.8 Graceful Pause Protocol). **Not implemented**: external session watcher (`mpl-session-watcher.sh`), hooks.json registration, end-to-end integration tests |

#### Sprint 5-6 New Features

| ID | Item | Related files | Sprint |
|----|------|--------------|--------|
| F-34 | Auto-Permission Learning | `mpl-auto-permit.mjs`, `mpl-permit-learner.mjs` | Sprint 5 |
| F-40 | Test Agent Mandatory | Gate 1 requires mpl-test-agent | Sprint 6 |
| F-50 | Gate 1.5 Coverage | Coverage threshold gate | Sprint 6 |

#### LOW — Maintenance

| ID | Item | Status | Description |
|----|------|--------|-------------|
| F-05 | Phase 0 cache partial invalidation | ✅ **S5 complete** | Re-analyze only changed modules based on git diff. `analyzePartialInvalidation()` + `partialCacheSave()` implemented |
| F-06 | Multi-project support | Not implemented | Independent pipeline per project in monorepo environment |

### Adaptive Pipeline Router Detailed Design (F-20, F-21, F-22)

#### Pipeline Score Formula

Calculated after Quick Scope Scan in Triage (Step 0):

```
pipeline_score = (file_scope × 0.35) + (test_complexity × 0.25)
               + (dependency_depth × 0.25) + (risk_signal × 0.15)

file_scope:       min(affected_files / 10, 1.0)
test_complexity:  min(test_scenarios / 8, 1.0)
dependency_depth: min(import_chain_depth / 5, 1.0)
risk_signal:      keyword_hint or prompt analysis (0.0~1.0)
```

Quick Scope Scan completes in ~1-2K tokens using only Glob/Grep. A lightweight version of the existing Step 2 codebase analysis.

#### 3-Tier Pipeline Mapping

| Tier | Score | Execution steps | Skipped | Expected tokens |
|------|-------|----------------|---------|----------------|
| **Frugal** (< 0.3) | Simple bug fix, 1-2 files | Bug Analysis → Fix → Gate 1 → Commit | Triage, PP, Phase 0, Decomposition, Gate 2/3 | ~5-15K |
| **Standard** (0.3~0.65) | Small feature, 3-5 files | Triage(skip) → PP(light) → Phase 0(Error Spec) → single Phase → Gate 1 → Commit | Full PP, Phase 0 Step 1-3, Decomposition (multi-phase), Gate 2/3 | ~20-40K |
| **Frontier** (> 0.65) | Complex task, 6+ files | Full 9+ step pipeline | None | ~50-100K+ |

User hint override: `"mpl bugfix"` → force tier to frugal, `"mpl small"` → force standard. Auto-calculated if no hint.

#### Dynamic Escalation Protocol

```
[Frugal] ──circuit break──→ [Standard] ──circuit break──→ [Frontier]
                              │                              │
                              ├─ Preserve completed TODOs    ├─ Preserve completed phases
                              ├─ Restructure failed TODOs    ├─ Re-decompose failed phases
                              │  as single Phase             │
                              └─ PP extraction (light)       └─ Full PP + Phase 0
```

Record `escalation_history` in state.json on escalation:

```json
{
  "pipeline_tier": "standard",
  "escalation_history": [
    {"from": "frugal", "to": "standard", "reason": "circuit_break", "preserved_todos": 3}
  ]
}
```

#### Routing Pattern File Format (F-22)

```jsonl
{"ts":"2026-03-07T10:00:00Z","desc":"add validation to endpoint","tier":"standard","result":"success","tokens":32400,"files":4}
{"ts":"2026-03-07T11:30:00Z","desc":"fix typo in error message","tier":"frugal","result":"success","tokens":8200,"files":1}
{"ts":"2026-03-07T14:00:00Z","desc":"refactor auth module","tier":"frontier","result":"success","tokens":87000,"files":12}
{"ts":"2026-03-07T15:00:00Z","desc":"add input sanitization","tier":"frugal","escalated":"standard","result":"success","tokens":28000,"files":3}
```

Matching via Jaccard similarity (tokenized intersection/union, threshold 0.8):

```
new_task: "add email validation to signup endpoint"
match:    "add validation to endpoint" (similarity=0.83) → tier=standard recommended
```

### RUNBOOK.md Format (F-10)

```markdown
# RUNBOOK — {task description}
Started: 2026-03-07T10:00:00Z

## Current Status
- Phase: 3/5 (phase-3: Add validation layer)
- Pipeline Mode: full
- Maturity: standard

## Milestone Progress
- [x] Phase 1: DB schema migration — PASS (4/4 criteria)
- [x] Phase 2: API endpoints — PASS (6/6 criteria)
- [ ] Phase 3: Validation layer — IN PROGRESS (2/5 criteria)
- [ ] Phase 4: Error handling
- [ ] Phase 5: Integration tests

## Key Decisions
- PD-001: chose Zod over Joi for validation (PP-02 type safety)
- PD-003: split user/admin routes (decomposer recommendation)

## Known Issues
- ISS-001: rate limiter not tested under load (H-item, deferred)

## Blockers
(none)

## How to Resume
Load: pivot-points.md + decomposition.yaml + this file
Next: Phase 3 TODO #3 — email format validator
```

### learnings.md Format (F-11)

```markdown
# MPL Learnings (auto-accumulated)
Last updated: 2026-03-07

## Failure Patterns
- [2026-03-05] Type mismatch: Python dict vs TypedDict — always use TypedDict
- [2026-03-07] pytest fixture scope confusion — default to "function" scope

## Success Patterns
- [2026-03-05] Zod schema shared between frontend/backend validation
- [2026-03-07] Error spec from Phase 0 eliminated all debugging

## Project Conventions (discovered)
- Import order: stdlib > third-party > local (enforced by ruff)
- Test naming: test_{module}_{scenario}_{expected}
```

## Conclusion

Through the v1.0→v3.0 evolution, MPL has grown into a pipeline that backs the principle "prevention is better than cure" with empirical data. v3.2 adds two more principles:

1. **"Documents are memory"** — ensuring continuity not only within a single execution but also between sessions and executions
2. **"Don't ask users to judge complexity"** — adaptive pipeline routing inspired by Ouroboros PAL Router, eliminating entry barriers for lightweight tasks through single entry point + automatic tier classification + dynamic escalation
